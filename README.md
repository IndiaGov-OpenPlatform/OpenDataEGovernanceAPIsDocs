OpenData and E-Governance APIs - Policy and Technical Standards
===========================

##Preamble:

Government of India (GoI) aims to make all Government services digitally accessible to the common person in his/her locality through common service delivery outlets. To meet this objective, there is a need for an interoperable ecosystem of data, applications and processes which will make the right information available to the right user at the right time.

In order to make rapid progress in this direction, Government of India (GoI) has initiated various programs including Mission Mode Projects (MMPs). In this context, it is important to ensure interoperability among various e-Governance systems to upgrade the quality and effectiveness of service delivery. This would also facilitate the single-window concept to deliver the required electronic services by various Government organizations.

For promoting Open Standards for software interoperability across various Government departments and agencies, GoI has already notified “Policy on Open Standards for e-Governance” and “Technical Standards on Interoperability Framework for e-Governance”. The world-wide initiatives on “Open Government” also focus on APIs to easily access the information available with or collected by Government Organizations.

In view of the above, there is a need to formulate a policy for the Government Organizations in India to provide Open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The “Policy on Open APIs for Government of India” (hereinafter referred to as the “Policy”) will encourage formal use of Open APIs in Government Organizations. This policy sets out the Government’s approach on the use of “Open APIs” to promote software interoperability for all e-Governance applications & systems and provide access to data & services for promoting participation of citizens and other stakeholders.
###1. Objectives of the policy:

The objectives of this policy are to:

- Ensure that APIs are published by all Government Organisations for all e-Governance applications and systems.
- Enable quick and transparent integration with other e-Governance applications and systems.
- Enable secure and reliable sharing of information and data across various e-Governance applications and systems.
- ￼￼￼Provide APIs for data collection and making information and data available to public.
- Provide guidance to Government Organizations in developing, publishing and using these Open APIs.
###2. Definitions
Please refer Appendix – I (Please Refer: Policy on Open APIs.pdf)

###3. Policy Statement

Government of India shall adopt Open APIs to enable quick and transparent integration with other e-Governance applications and systems implemented by various Government Organizations and to make information and data available to the public, thereby providing access to data and services to all stakeholders and promoting citizen participation.

The Open APIs shall have the following characteristics for publishing and consuming:

- ￼￼￼3.1 The relevant information being provided by all Government Organisations through their respective e-Governance applications shall be open and machine readable.

- 3.2 All the relevant information and data of a Government Organisation shall be made available through Open APIs to other e-governance applications and systems and public, as per the classification given in the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) 2012.

- 3.3 All the relevant information, data and functionalities within an e-Governance application or system of a Government Organisation shall be made available to other e-Governance applications and systems through Open APIs.

- ￼3.4 A Government Organisation consuming the data and information from other e- Governance applications and systems using Open APIs shall manage information handling, authentication, authorisation and auditing through a process as defined by the API publishing Organisation.

- 3.5 Each published API of a Government Organization shall be accessible free of charge to other Government Organizations and public.

- 3.6 Each published API shall be properly documented with sample code and sufficient information for developers to make use of the API.

- 3.7 The life-cycle of the Open API shall be made available by the API publishing ￼Government Organisation. The API shall preferably be backward compatible with earlier versions.

###4. Nature of Compliance
Mandatory

###5. Applicability
The policy shall be applicable to all Government Organisations under the Central Government and those State Governments that choose to adopt this policy for the following categories of e- Governance systems:
All new e-Governance applications and systems being considered for implementation. New versions of the legacy and existing systems.

###6. Implementation Mechanism
* GoI shall formulate detailed implementation guidelines for rapid and effective adoption of the policy.

* Government Organisations shall publish the APIs so that the public can access relevant information and data from e-Governance applications and systems.

* Government Organisations shall publish the APIs for integrating with their e-Governance applications and systems.

* Government Organisations shall integrate with the e-Governance applications and systems of other departments through the messaging gateway built on open standards by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) under the National e- Governance Plan (NeGP).

* Government Organisations shall ensure compliance with notified XML standards for developing APIs.

* GoI shall constitute an oversight committee under the chairmanship of Secretary, DeitY for facilitating the implementation of this policy and its provisions thereof.

###7. Review of the Policy
GoI shall have the right to review and revise the policy as and when required.

###8. Point of Contact
All queries or comments related to the “Policy on Open APIs for Government of India” shall be directed to the Joint Secretary (e-Governance), DeitY at jsegov@deity.gov.in.
